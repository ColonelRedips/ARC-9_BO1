ATT.Description = [[
    Rare M607a parts that fit an 11.5 barrel.
    The M607a was a very early carbine version of the M16 marketed as an SMG, not for its caliber, but instead for its role as a compact weapon for rear echelon troops, vehicle drives and tank crews.
    Ergonomics aren't the best and it makes controlling the weapon's recoil a bit harder, though it is lighter than the ribbed handguard.
